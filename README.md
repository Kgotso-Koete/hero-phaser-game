### Acknowledgements

Thank you to [Jed Hastwell](https://www.udemy.com/user/jedhastwell/) for a good [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/html5-game-development-2d-platform-game-fundamentals/). The tutorial was a good intro to Phaser. It was also detailed in showing learners where to find free game assets, how to modify assets for use using free tools and how to create levels. Jed explained everything very well and clearly. The only problem was that the topics were not broad enough to give learners an idea of what a complete game system in Phaser could look like. It did not have to cover everything but could have had sections on enemies/obstacles, health etc. The hardest part of learning to build any software system is learning how to compose various components/systems together.The tutorial was still worth it because it was only about 4.5 hours long, which makes for a good intro to Phaser. Rated 3.5 out of 5 starts from me.
